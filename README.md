## What is Neeroh?
Neeroh is a paper trading app like none other. Neeroh allows users to invest in paper stocks and paper cryptocurrencies with one idea in mind â€” the better you perform, the more profit you earn.

## How does Neeroh work?
When you start using Neeroh, you have a in-app balance of $0. You can watch ads to gain free paper currency or input your own currency. When you invest your in-app balance into a stock or cryptocurrency, however well your investment does determines your Neeroh Rank. There is an individual achivement board and a global leaderboard of highest rated individuals. At the end of each quarter, successful individuals and the top 100 on the leaderboard are rewarded in the form of our crypto currency, Neeroh.

## How is my Neeroh Rank determined?
Every player's Neeroh Rank is calculated using the below equation:
  
nr = ((percentageGained*.75) + (balanceAmount*.25))
  
The better a user's investments peform and the higher a user's balanced becomes increases a user's Neeroh Rank. In order to deter users from simply raising their rank by investing vast amounts of money into their account, we limit the amount of outside money that affects Neeroh Rank.
